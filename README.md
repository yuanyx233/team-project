# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.

## User Stories
### As a student player, I want to choose my major and courses and attend classes and exams so that I can earn a good GPA.
### User Story 2
### User Story 3 — Food and Work (US3)
**Lead:** Zhenbin An (UC3)

As a player, I want to spend Money on food at the food truck or café to restore Energy, and work café shifts to earn Money, so that I can balance my resources throughout the school day.

**Responsibilities within UC3:**
1. Implement food and eating: show available meals, let the player buy food, deduct Money, and restore Energy.
2. Implement café work: let the player complete a shift, earn Money, and spend Energy and time.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The player can view the day's menu, including each item's price and Energy gain.
- Buying an affordable item deducts its price, restores Energy, and uses part of the current time slot.
- Working a café shift pays Money based on correctly served orders, deducts Energy, and uses the time slot.
- Unaffordable meals, insufficient Energy for a shift, and closed locations give clear feedback without applying an invalid action.
- If the meal API is unavailable, the player can still use a bundled fallback menu.

### User Story 4
(Add additional user stories as needed.)

## Use Cases
### Use Case 1.1: Choose a major and enrol in courses
Primary actor: student player 

Preconditions: 
- A game has started
- The player has not finalized their academic choices for the current semester
- The game has a predefined catalogue of majors and courses

Trigger: The player asks to set up their academic plan

Success outcome: The selected major and courses are recorded, and the player can view their confirmed academic plan.

Main success scenario:
1. The system displays the available majors. 
2. The player selects a major. 
3. The system displays the courses available for that major and the permitted number of selections. 
4. The player selects courses and submits their academic plan. 
5. The system checks that the selections meet the enrolment rules. 
6. The system records the major and selected courses. 
7. The system displays the confirmed academic plan.

Extensions:
- 4a. The player cancels before confirming.
  The system ends the selection process without changing the recorded academic plan.
- 5a. The selections do not meet the enrolment rules.
  The system explains what must change and allows the player to revise their selections. No invalid plan is recorded

### Use Case 1.2: Attend a class
Primary actor: Student player

Preconditions:
- The player is enrolled in a course.
- The current semester is in progress.
- The game has class content available for that course.

Trigger: The player asks to attend a class for an enrolled course.

Success outcome: The class is recorded as completed, and the player sees their participation result.

Main success scenario:
1. The player requests to attend a class for an enrolled course.
2. The system checks that the class is available and has not already been completed.
3. The system presents the class material and a short practice question.
4. The player submits an answer.
5. The system evaluates the answer and displays feedback.
6. The system records the class as completed.
7. The system displays the updated course progress.

Extensions:
- 2a. The class is unavailable or already completed.
  The system explains why it cannot be attended. Course progress remains unchanged.
- 4a. The player submits no answer.
  The system asks the player to provide an answer and continues the class.
- 4b. The player leaves before submitting.
  The class is not recorded as completed, and course progress remains unchanged.
- 5a. The answer is incorrect.
  The system explains the correct answer. The class is still recorded as completed, with the actual participation result.

### Use Case 1.3: Take a course exam
Primary actor: Student player
Preconditions:
- The player is enrolled in the selected course.
- The game has exam questions and a grading rule for that course.
- The player has an academic record that can store course results.

Trigger: The player asks to take the course exam.

Success outcome: The exam score and corresponding course grade are recorded, the GPA is recalculated, and the player sees the results.

Main success scenario:
1. The player requests to take an exam for an enrolled course.
2. The system checks that the exam is available and has not already been completed.
3. The system explains the exam rules and presents the questions.
4. The player answers the questions and submits the exam.
5. The system checks that all required questions have answers.
6. The system evaluates the answers and calculates the exam score.
7. The system determines the course grade using the agreed grading rule.
8. The system records the result and recalculates the player’s GPA.
9. The system displays the exam score, course grade, and updated GPA.

Extensions:
- 2a. The exam is unavailable or already completed.
  The system explains why the exam cannot be started. Grades and GPA remain unchanged.
- 5a. Required answers are missing.
  The system identifies the unanswered questions and allows the player to complete them before resubmitting.
- 4a. The player cancels before submission.
  Under the proposed MVP rule, the attempt is discarded. No grade is recorded, and GPA remains unchanged.
- 8a. The system cannot record the result.
  The system reports that finalization failed and allows a retry without awarding the result twice.

### Use Case 2
### Use Case 3A — Buy Food and Eat (UC3A)

**Primary actor:** Player

**Trigger:** The player interacts with the food truck or café counter and chooses to eat.

**Preconditions:** A game is in progress, and the location is open in the current time slot.

**Main success flow:**
1. The game obtains today's menu through the menu gateway and shows meal prices and Energy gains.
2. The player selects a meal.
3. The game checks the player's Money, then deducts the price, restores Energy, and uses part of the time slot.
4. The HUD shows the updated Money, Energy, and time.

**Alternatives:** If the meal API fails, use the bundled fallback menu. If the player cannot afford a meal, show the shortfall and do not deduct Money or advance time. If the location is closed, show its opening hours.

**Success outcome:** The player has eaten; Money decreases by the meal price, Energy increases, and time advances.

### Use Case 3B — Work a Café Shift (UC3B)

**Primary actor:** Player

**Trigger:** The player interacts with the café counter and chooses to work a shift.

**Preconditions:** A game is in progress, and the café is open in the current time slot.

**Main success flow:**
1. The game checks that the player has enough Energy and whether the shift overlaps a scheduled class.
2. Customers order menu items; the player chooses the matching items.
3. The game pays Money based on correct orders, deducts Energy, uses the time slot, and updates the HUD.

**Alternatives:** If the player lacks Energy, explain why the shift cannot start. If a shift overlaps a class, warn that the class will be missed and ask for confirmation; if confirmed, UC1 handles the absence. If the café is closed, show its opening hours. If meal data is unavailable, use the bundled fallback menu for customer orders.

**Success outcome:** The completed shift increases Money according to correct orders, decreases Energy, and advances time.

## Entities
### MenuItem (UC3)
Represents a meal offered on the menu, with a name, price, and Energy gain. The game sets prices and Energy values; provider-specific API data stays outside the entity.

### Entity 1
### Entity 2
### Entity 3
(Add additional entities as needed.)
---
## API Usage
**Planned UC3 API:** [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

**How it will be used:** A menu gateway obtains meal data for the food truck and café and converts selected meals into `MenuItem` values. A bundled menu keeps UC3 playable when the service is unavailable. Access requirements and a successful Java request still need to be verified before integration.
