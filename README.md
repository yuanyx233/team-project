## User Stories
### As a student player, I want to choose my major and courses and attend classes and exams so that I can earn a good GPA.
### User Story 2
### User Story 3 — Food and Work (US3)
**Lead:** Zhenbin An (UC3)

As a player, I want to spend Money on food at the food truck or café to restore Energy, and work café shifts to earn Money, so that I can balance my resources throughout the school day.

**Responsibilities within UC3:**
1. Implement food and eating: show available meals, let the player buy food, deduct Money, and restore Energy.
2. Implement café work: let the player complete a shift, earn Money, and spend Energy and time.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The player can view the day's menu, including each item's price and Energy gain.
- Buying an affordable item deducts its price, restores Energy, and uses part of the current time slot.
- Working a café shift pays Money based on correctly served orders, deducts Energy, and uses the time slot.
- Unaffordable meals, insufficient Energy for a shift, and closed locations give clear feedback without applying an invalid action.
- If the meal API is unavailable, the player can still use a bundled fallback menu.

### User Story 4.1 — Build Campus Relationships

  Under the proposed MVP rule, the attempt is discarded. No grade is recorded, and GPA remains unchanged.
- 8a. The system cannot record the result.
  The system reports that finalization failed and allows a retry without awarding the result twice.

### Use Case 2
### Use Case 3A — Buy Food and Eat (UC3A)

**Primary actor:** Player

**Trigger:** The player interacts with the food truck or café counter and chooses to eat.

**Preconditions:** A game is in progress, and the location is open in the current time slot.

**Main success flow:**
1. The game obtains today's menu through the menu gateway and shows meal prices and Energy gains.
2. The player selects a meal.
3. The game checks the player's Money, then deducts the price, restores Energy, and uses part of the time slot.
4. The HUD shows the updated Money, Energy, and time.

**Alternatives:** If the meal API fails, use the bundled fallback menu. If the player cannot afford a meal, show the shortfall and do not deduct Money or advance time. If the location is closed, show its opening hours.

**Success outcome:** The player has eaten; Money decreases by the meal price, Energy increases, and time advances.

### Use Case 3B — Work a Café Shift (UC3B)

**Primary actor:** Player

**Trigger:** The player interacts with the café counter and chooses to work a shift.

**Preconditions:** A game is in progress, and the café is open in the current time slot.

**Main success flow:**
1. The game checks that the player has enough Energy and whether the shift overlaps a scheduled class.
2. Customers order menu items; the player chooses the matching items.
3. The game pays Money based on correct orders, deducts Energy, uses the time slot, and updates the HUD.

**Alternatives:** If the player lacks Energy, explain why the shift cannot start. If a shift overlaps a class, warn that the class will be missed and ask for confirmation; if confirmed, UC1 handles the absence. If the café is closed, show its opening hours. If meal data is unavailable, use the bundled fallback menu for customer orders.

**Success outcome:** The completed shift increases Money according to correct orders, decreases Energy, and advances time.

### Use Case 4.1 — Talk with an NPC
**Primary actor:** Player

**Preconditions:**
- A game is in progress.
- The player is near an NPC.

**Trigger:** The player asks to talk with the NPC.

**Success outcome:** The player receives an NPC reply, the completed
conversation is recorded, and Friendship with that NPC increases. Later
conversations with other NPCs can refer to characters the player has met.

**Main success scenario:**
1. The player asks to talk with an NPC.
2. The system confirms that the NPC is available and shows the current
   Friendship level.
3. The player sends a message.
4. The system gives an in-character reply. The reply may refer to another
   character the player has previously talked with.
5. The system records who the player talked with and the conversation.
6. The system increases Friendship with this NPC and advances game time.
7. The system shows the reply and updated Friendship level.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. The NPC is unavailable:** The system explains this and ends the
  interaction without changing Friendship or time.
- **3a. The message is empty or too long:** The system asks for a revised
  message and returns to step 3 without changing game state.
- **4a. A suitable reply cannot be obtained:** The system provides an
  in-character fallback reply and continues at step 5.
- **4b. The player leaves before a reply is ready:** The late reply is
  ignored; no conversation is recorded and game state does not change.
- **6a. Friendship reaches the NPC's event threshold:** The system unlocks
  that NPC's event once and informs the player.

### Use Case 4.2 — Check Campus Email

**Primary actor:** Player

**Preconditions:**
- A game is in progress.
- The player has an in-game campus mailbox.

**Trigger:** The player opens the mailbox.

**Success outcome:** The player can read delivered emails. Reading a course
reminder shows the relevant assignment and due date. If the player replies
to a job offer, the result changes their in-game Money and the offer is
marked resolved.

**Main success scenario:**
1. The player opens the mailbox.
2. The system lists delivered emails and identifies unread messages.
3. The player opens a course reminder.
4. The system shows the course, assignment, and due date.
5. The system marks the reminder as read.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. The mailbox is empty:** The system shows that there is no mail.
- **3a. The player opens a job-offer email:**
    1. The system shows the offer.
    2. The player chooses to reply.
    3. The system determines whether the player gains or loses Money.
    4. The system applies the result, shows what happened, and marks the
       offer resolved so it cannot be answered again.
- **3b. The player ignores a job offer:** Money does not change and the
  offer remains unresolved.
- **3c. The player opens an already resolved offer:** The system shows the
  previous result but does not allow another reply.

## Entities
### MenuItem (UC3)
Represents a meal offered on the menu, with a name, price, and Energy gain. The game sets prices and Energy values; provider-specific API data stays outside the entity.

### Entity 1
### Entity 2
### Entity 3
(Add additional entities as needed.)
---
## API Usage
**Planned UC3 API:** [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

**How it will be used:** A menu gateway obtains meal data for the food truck and café and converts selected meals into `MenuItem` values. A bundled menu keeps UC3 playable when the service is unavailable. Access requirements and a successful Java request still need to be verified before integration.
